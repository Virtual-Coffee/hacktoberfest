                Virtual Coffee is a supportive community of developers at all stages of the journey. It started as a twice-weekly zoom chat about life and tech, but we've grown a lot in the last five months! We do a little bit of everything, which includes a thriving slack group, special events, mentoring sessions, and good people. If you're interested in joining, you can come to an event by signing up <a href="https://meetingplace.io/virtual-coffee" class="text-orange-500 underline">here</a>.

                Hacktoberfest is a month-long virtual event that encourages and supports open-source contributions. Open Source Software (OSS) is code that the public can view, contribute to, and use. Sponsored by Digital Ocean and DEV, a contributor can qualify for the official Hacktoberfest swag by <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com" class="text-orange-500 underline">registering</a> and making four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31.

              Maintainers are the owners of the open source project. They keep track of the work, review incoming PR requests and issues, and make sure things get merged. They keep the project up to date and when possible connect developers to issues. Good maintainers aren't necessarily the best coders or reviewers, but they
              help others navigate the project and anticipate and remove difficulties when they can.

               A contributor is someone who submits code or documentation to an open source project as a pull request on Github but usually does not have the ability to merge their contributions. Contributors can find issues to work on in open source repositories. To get started as an open source contributor for Hacktoberfest, all you need to do is to <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/" class="text-orange-500 underline">sign up</a> and have/create a <a href="https://github.com/" class="text-orange-500 underline">Github account</a>.

                Our goal is to provide support for contributors and maintainers. We want everyone to have an opportunity to contribute, regardless of their experience. Likewise, we want to provide maintainers with support to create projects that are contributor-friendly and will lead to repeat contributions beyond Hacktoberfest. Our goal is to make tech a friendly place for everyone.

                Because not everyone will need the same level or type of support, we're working to accommodate as many needs as possible. This could include 1:1 mentorship, access to private slack channels, a group coding session, a review of the project you're using for Hacktoberfest, or general community support. We're also here to cheer you on throughout the month, whether on social media, through our events, or slack.
